# BuildAPortfolioSite_Gidenko_p1
this is my project for Udacity

in order for me to complete this project i had to heavily rely on those who went before me.

The sources that I used were information provided in the Udacity courses:
Intro to HTML and CSS, Responsive Web Design Fundamentals, Responsive Images, 
Youtube videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcMjo_wczCc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up_NC-qGzuI,

Grunt.com, andismith.com and google hangout meeting

book:
HTML&CSS Design and build websites by JON DUCKET

there might be some issues with the way the images behave when they are scaled beyond 600px. will continue to research and refine
